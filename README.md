# NicLoadOff — SmartNIC Offload Simulator

NicLoadOff is a discrete-event simulation framework for exploring dynamic SmartNIC offload policies. The project targets asymmetric host↔NIC systems (e.g., NVIDIA BlueField) and evaluates how state-aware policies compare with static, all-host or all-NIC baselines across realistic workloads.

## Project Goals
- Model hosts, SmartNIC SoCs, DRAM limits, and interconnect latencies/bandwidth with configurable profiles.
- Express workloads as task DAGs with placement annotations.
- Provide a minimal policy DSL that consumes runtime state snapshots and issues placement decisions.
- Deliver reproducible experiments that sweep arrival rates, background loads, and path degradations while collecting throughput, latency (mean/p99), and resource utilization.

Primary planning artifacts live in `scope.md` (goals, success criteria) and `status.md` (phase-by-phase progress).

## Repository Layout
- `sim/` — simulator engine (event loop, resource models).
- `policies/` — policy DSL parser/runtime and stock policies.
- `workloads/` — workload DAG specs, arrival models, templates.
- `profiles/` — hardware parameter files (e.g., BlueField-2).
- `experiments/` — experiment manifests, run logs, and results.
- `plots/` — analysis scripts and generated figures.
- `thesis/` — writing assets for the final report.
- `AGENTS.md` — contributor quickstart and workflow notes.
- `scope.md` — Phase 0 scope and success criteria.
- `status.md` — rolling project status (Done / Next / Remaining).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- CMake ≥ 3.20
- Ninja (recommended) or another generator
- A C++20-compatible toolchain (Clang 17+, GCC 11+, or MSVC 2022)

### Configure & Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
ctest --test-dir build
```

The initial smoke test exercises the placeholder event queue implementation; expand the suite as simulator modules arrive.

## Technology Stack (current plan)
- C++20 for simulator and policy modules.
- YAML/JSON for hardware profiles and workload specifications.
- Python (matplotlib / seaborn) for data reduction and plotting.

## Contributing
Please read `AGENTS.md` for guidelines on status tracking, coding style, and PR expectations. Update `status.md` after each work session to record progress and queue follow-up tasks.
